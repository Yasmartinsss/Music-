            <h2>Lose Yourself - Eminem</h2>
            <h3>Letra:</h3>
            <p>"Look<br>
                If you had one shot or one opportunity<br>
                To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment<br>
                Would you capture it<br>
                Or just let it slip? Yo<br>
                His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy<br>
                There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti<br>
                He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready<br>
                To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'<br>
                What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud<br>
                He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out<br>
                He's chokin' how everybody's jokin' now<br>
                The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow<br>
                Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity, ope<br>
                There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad, but he won't<br>
                Give up that easy, no, he won't have it<br>
                He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope<br>
                He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows<br>
                When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's<br>
                Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody<br>
                Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him and<br>
                (You better lose) yourself in the music<br>
                The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
                (You better lose) yourself in the music<br>
                The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
                You better<br>
                His soul's escapin' through this hole that is gapin'<br>
                This world is mine for the takin', make me king<br>
                As we move toward a new world order<br>
                A normal life is borin', but superstardom's<br>
                Close to postmortem, it only grows harder<br>
                Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over<br>
                These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows<br>
                He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads<br>
                God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father<br>
                He goes home and barely knows his own daughter<br>
                But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water<br>
                These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product<br>
                They moved on to the next schmoe who flows<br>
                He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera<br>
                Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner<br>
                But the beat goes on<br>
                Da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah<br>
                (You better lose) yourself in the music<br>
                The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
                (You better lose) yourself in the music<br>
                The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
                You better<br>
                No more games, I'ma change what you call rage<br>
                Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged<br>
                I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed<br>
                I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage<br>
                But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher<br>
                Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper<br>
                All the pain inside amplified by the<br>
                Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-five<br>
                And I can't provide the right type of life for my family<br>
                'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers<br>
                And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life<br>
                And these times are so hard and it's gettin' even harder<br>
                Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter<br>
                Caught up between being a father and a prima donna<br>
                Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna<br>
                Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's<br>
                Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got<br>
                To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot<br>
                Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not<br>
                Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go<br>
                I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot<br>
                So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not<br>
                This may be the only opportunity that I got<br>
                (You better lose) yourself in the music<br>
                The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
                (You better lose) yourself in the music<br>
                The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
                You better<br>
                (You can do anything you set your mind to, man)"</p>
