            <h3>Letra:</h3>
            <p>"Strumming my pain with his fingers<br>
                Singing my life with his words<br>
                Killing me softly with his song<br>
                Killing me softly with his song<br>
                Telling my whole life with his words<br>
                Killing me softly with his song<br>
                (Ah) yo! (Yeah! Yeah!)<br>
                This is Wyclef, Refugee Camp (L-Boogie up in here)<br>
                Pra'zrel (Pra'zrel up in here)<br>
                Lil Base sits up there on the base (Refugees up in here)<br>
                While I'm on this, I got my girl L<br>
                One time (one time), one time (one time)<br>
                Ayo, L, you know you got the lyrics<br>
                I heard he sang a good song<br>
                I heard he had a style<br>
                And so I came to see him<br>
                And listen for a while<br>
                And there he was<br>
                This young boy, stranger to my eyes<br>
                Strumming my pain with his fingers (one time, one time)<br>
                Singing my life with his words (two times, two times)<br>
                Killing me softly with this song<br>
                Killing me softly with his song<br>
                Telling my whole life with his words<br>
                Killing me softly with his song<br>
                I felt all flushed with fever<br>
                Embarrassed by the crowd<br>
                I felt he found my letters<br>
                Then read each one out loud<br>
                I prayed that he would finish<br>
                But he just kept right on<br>
                Strumming my pain with his fingers (one time, one time)<br>
                Singing my life with his words (two times, two times)<br>
                Killing me softly with his song<br>
                Killing me softly with his song<br>
                Telling my whole life with his words<br>
                Killing me softly with his song<br>
                (Yo, L-Boog, take me to the bridge!)<br>
                Whoa, whoa<br>
                La-la-la, la-la-la<br>
                Whoa, la<br>
                Whoa, la<br>
                La<br>
                Strumming my pain with his fingers (yes, he was singing)<br>
                Yes he was singing my life with his words<br>
                Killing me softly with his song<br>
                Killing me softly with his song<br>
                Telling my whole life with his words<br>
                Killing me softly with his song<br>
                Strumming my pain, yeah (strumming my pain)<br>
                Yo, put your hands together for L-Boogie from the Refugee Camp (yeah, yeah)<br>
                (Singing my life) you know how we do<br>
                (Up in here, L-Boogie up in here) Wyclef, Pra'zrel (said L-Boogie up in here)<br>
                (Wyclef up in here) my man Lil Base<br>
                (Pra'zrel up in here) Jerry, one time<br>
                (T-Rocks up in here, we got Warren up in here)<br>
                This is how we—<br>
                (Warren up, up in here, Outsiders up here) Refugee Camp<br>
                Refugee Camp (we got Fallon up in here, Mulaney, Mulaney's up in here)<br>
                (We got Val' up in here)<br>
                Everybody got a breaking point, kid, and they'll rat on you<br>
                The family niggas'll rat on you<br>
                That's why we gotta be prepared to take out whoever we need to<br>
                (Man, motherfucker, I told you I was gonna get you next)"</p>
