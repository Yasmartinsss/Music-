            <h2>Waterfalls - TLC</h2>
            <h3>Letra:</h3>
            <p>"A lonely mother gazing out of the window<br>
                Staring at a son that she just can't touch<br>
                If at any time, he's in a jam, she'll be by his side<br>
                But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much<br>
                But all the praying just ain't helping at all<br>
                'Cause he can't seem to keep hisself out of trouble<br>
                So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how<br>
                Another body laying cold in the gutter<br>
                Listen to me<br>
                Don't go chasing waterfalls<br>
                Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to<br>
                I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all<br>
                But I think you're moving too fast<br>
                Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation<br>
                But he just can't see<br>
                She gives him loving that his body can't handle<br>
                But all he can say is: Baby, it's good to me<br>
                One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror<br>
                But he doesn't recognize his own face<br>
                His health is fading, and he doesn't know why<br>
                Three letters took him to his final resting place<br>
                Y'all don't hear me<br>
                Don't go chasing waterfalls<br>
                Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to<br>
                I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all<br>
                (Your way or no way)<br>
                But I think you're moving too fast<br>
                Don't go chasing waterfalls<br>
                Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to<br>
                I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all<br>
                But I think you're moving too fast<br>
                Come on!<br>
                I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms<br>
                Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray<br>
                Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray<br>
                All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days<br>
                And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo<br>
                The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew<br>
                Clear blue and unconditional skies<br>
                Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries<br>
                My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope<br>
                With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain<br>
                Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?<br>
                What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain<br>
                You claim the insane, and name this day in time<br>
                For falling prey to crime<br>
                I say the system's got you victim to your own mind<br>
                Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true<br>
                Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you<br>
                Don't go chasing waterfalls<br>
                Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to<br>
                I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all<br>
                But I think you're moving too fast<br>
                Don't go chasing waterfalls<br>
                Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to<br>
                I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all<br>
                But I think you're moving too fast (ooh, you're movin' too fast)<br>
                Don't go chasing waterfalls (don't go, don't go)<br>
                Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to<br>
                I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all<br>
                (I know, I know, your way hey)<br>
                But I think you're moving too fast"</p>
