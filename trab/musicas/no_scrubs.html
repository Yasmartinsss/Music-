                A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly<br>
                And is also known as a buster<br>
                Always talkin' about what he wants<br>
                And just sits on his broke ass, so<br>
                No, I don't want your number<br>
                No, I don't wanna give you mine, and<br>
                No, I don't wanna meet you nowhere<br>
                No, I don't want none of your time, and<br>
                No, I don't want no scrub<br>
                A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me<br>
                Hangin' out the passenger side<br>
                Of his best friend's ride<br>
                Tryin' to holla at me<br>

                Tryin' to holla at me<br>
                Well, a scrub's checkin' me, but his game is kinda weak<br>
                And I know that he cannot approach me<br>
                'Cause I'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash<br>
                Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass, so<br>
                No, I don't want your number<br>
                No, I don't wanna give you mine, and<br>
                No, I don't wanna meet you nowhere<br>
                No, I don't want none of your time<br>

                If you don't have a car and you're walkin'<br>
                Oh yes, son, I'm talkin' to you<br>
                If you live at home with your momma<br>
                Oh yes, son, I'm talkin' to you<br>
                If you have a shorty but you don't show love<br>
                Oh yes, son, I'm talkin' to you<br>
                Wanna get with me with no money?<br>
                Oh, no<br>

                See? If you can't spatially expand my horizons (horizons)<br>
                Then that leaves you in the class with scrubs, never risin' (risin')<br>
                I don't find it surprisin' if you don't have the G's (G's)<br>
                To please me and bounce from here to the coast of overseas<br>
                So (so), let me give you somethin' to think about (think about)<br>
                Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out (turn you out)<br>
                Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me (in front of me)<br>
                You as clear as DVD on digital TV screens (digital TV screens)<br>
                Satisfy my appetite with somethin' spectacular (spectacular)<br>
                Check your vernacular, and then I'll get back to ya (back to ya)<br>
                With diamond-like precision, insatiable is what I envision (envision)<br>
                Can't detect acquisition from your friend's expedition<br>
                Mister (mister) Big Willy, if you really wanna know (know, know)<br>
                Ask Chilli, could I be a silly ho? (Ho, ho) not really<br>
                T-Boz and all my señoritas are steppin' on your FILA's<br>
                But you don't hear me though (but you don't hear me though)<br>
